# module-6-weather-dashboard

## Overview

In preparation for an up coming trip, I created a weather outlook for multiple citys so I can view the weather and plan my trip accordingly.

I can view the city's:

- Current temperature
- Wind mph
- Humidity
- Weather for the next 5 days

## Installation:

1. `git clone git@github.com:PDKetchum/module-6-weather-dashboard.git`
2. Open `index.html`

## How to use:

- Type in a city
- Click "Search"
- To see the weather of previously searched cities, click the city name in the search history list
